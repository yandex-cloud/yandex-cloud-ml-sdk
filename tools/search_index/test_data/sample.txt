Sample Text File for Search Index Testing
==========================================

This is a simple text file used to test the search index uploader.

It contains multiple lines of text to ensure that file content
is properly read and uploaded to Yandex Cloud.

Key features being tested:
- File reading from local filesystem
- MIME type detection (text/plain)
- Content upload to Yandex Cloud Files API
- Search index creation from uploaded files

This file should be successfully processed by the LocalFileSource
and uploaded via the SearchIndexUploader.
